                        <h5>Engineering Leadership</h5>
                        Leading people has been a privilege I embarked on in 2010 when InfoVista entrusted me with an incredible opportunity: to establish a development site, create a groundbreaking product, and form a brand-new team from scratch. This marked the beginning of my leadership journey, and over the past 14 years, I have been immersed in an enriching and intensive learning experience.
                        <br>
                        My journey has taught me how to unlock the full potential of individuals, deliver high quality software efficiently using agile methodologies, manage budgets effectively, and invest equally in peers, superiors, and direct reports. This balanced approach has not only fostered my personal growth but has also driven my teams to excel.
                        <br>
                        I once believed that technology was the ultimate challenge, but my experiences have revealed that understanding and leading people is even more intricate and rewarding. With this wealth of knowledge, I am eager to contribute to your organization, bringing a unique blend of expertise, empathy, and camaraderie. Together, we will not only achieve our objectives but also enjoy a collaborative and thriving work environment.</p>

                        <h6>Product Development</h6>
                        I have always found great satisfaction in problem-solving and developing business solutions through product development. Since starting my career as a software engineer in 1999, I have built a diverse array of products across various industries including Telecom, Data Centers, Service Assurance, Airline Solutions, FinTech, Customer Experience, and more.
                        <br>
                        Throughout my journey, I have had the privilege of working with leading brands such as Alcatel, DELL-EMC, InfoVista, Sabre, Charles Schwab, Avaya, and offering consulting services to the Tolling Industry. These experiences have honed my ability to create impactful solutions that drive business success.
                        <br>
                        Some notable products that continue to carry my signature include V-Block, Vista-360, Crew Manager, the Schwab-Ameritrade merger, fuegotag.org, and hctra.org. Each of these projects reflects my commitment to excellence and innovation in every endeavor.

                        <h6>Technology Transformations</h6>
                        Over the past 25+ years, I have witnessed and actively participated in the ever-evolving technology landscape. As a pioneer adopter of these changes, I have led numerous proof-of-concept initiatives, steering them from inception to production. With each technological shift, I have grown in both knowledge and contribution.
                        <br>
                        My journey began with Pascal, Cobol, and MainFrame, followed by a significant transition to Object-Oriented development with Java, EJB, JBoss, Hibernate, MVC, and the Spring Framework. As technology advanced, I embraced OnPrem solutions, SaaS, and subsequently experienced a paradigm shift to Microservices, Kubernetes (K8S), Cloud Native, Containerization, DevOps, and DevSecOps. Currently, I have immersed myself in the realms of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), dedicating the past year and a half to these cutting-edge fields.
                        <br>
                        The beauty of technology lies in its rapid evolution, changing every 6-12 months. Staying abreast of these advancements allows us to adopt the latest trends, simplifying the development of software solutions for complex problem domains. This continuous learning journey has been immensely rewarding, and I am poised to bring transformative expertise to your organization, propelling you ahead of your competitors.

                        <h6>Process Transformations</h6>
                        The software industry has drawn significant process adoption insights from sectors such as Automobile, Manufacturing, and Assembly Line. I have experienced the traditional models of extensive requirement gathering, prolonged design phases, and lengthy development cycles, only to release products that fell short of solving the initial problem yet somehow managed to sell and then rectify through iterative fixes.
                        <br>
                        My true transformation into an Agilist began in 2008, when I was introduced to X-Planner at EMC (now DELL-EMC). This shift involved executing the steps of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in manageable increments—gathering just enough requirements, conducting just enough system design, performing just enough detailed design, implementing in small chunks, and constantly seeking customer feedback. This approach appealed to me greatly, as it enabled rapid adaptation and ensured we were genuinely addressing customer needs.
                        <br>
                        While I am not opposed to waterfall or other methodologies, my expertise lies in executing Agile principles correctly. For the past 16+ years, I have successfully implemented Agile practices, and the results speak for themselves. Utilizing the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) has allowed me to scale Agile processes across large organizations, maintaining the agility fundamental to incremental approaches.
                        <br>
                        I am equipped to bring this practical knowledge to your organization, ensuring a true transformation by engaging both the internal team and customer base effectively. This isn’t about simply reading the Agile Manifesto; it’s about fostering a culture of adaptability and customer-centric development that drives real value.

                            <P class="subtitle">While working with HCTRA and QuarterHill, I played a pivotal role in transforming HCTRA’s technology stack from an outdated JSP/Servlet implementation to a modern, lightweight, and easily scalable platform. This upgrade significantly improved the maintainability and performance of their self-service websites (fuegotag.org, hctra.org) and facilitated the evolution of their back-office systems from Oracle Stored Procedure-based web services to RESTful web services.
                            <br>
                            In addition to these advancements, I have been integrally involved in their Quality Governance initiatives, ensuring adherence to high standards throughout development processes. Most recently, I have taken the lead on their Business Continuity Planning (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR) initiatives, providing vital technology insights to both the teams and leadership while overseeing the implementation to ensure robustness and resilience.
                            <br>
                            Through these efforts, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to deliver transformative solutions, advocating for best practices and steering technology strategies that align with organizational goals.</P>

Leading a large team of talented software professionals, we developed robust integrations for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp, enabling customers to seamlessly communicate with Customer Experience (CX) agents through these popular platforms.
                            <br>
                            In addition to enhancing customer communication, we also rolled out the capability for running highly effective campaigns on Facebook for Qatar Airways. This strategic initiative opened up a lucrative revenue stream, complementing the existing email, SMS, and messaging channels.

                            <P class="subtitle">The acquisition of TD Ameritrade by Schwab presented a fantastic and unique opportunity that required scaling the trading volumes tenfold across multiple systems. This was no ordinary feat, especially given the mandate to achieve this within a stringent two-year timeline set by the Federal Reserve.
                            <br>
                            I architected a strategic approach to incrementally scale the various components of the system. By breaking the scalability project down into manageable phases, we were able to integrate and test these components quarterly, ensuring a seamless transition and continuous progress over an 18-month period. This methodical and agile process allowed us to meet the high demands of the acquisition in a structured and efficient manner.
                            <br>
                            This achievement was a significant milestone for Schwab, as it ensured an uninterrupted and seamless experience for customers during a period of substantial growth.</P>

                            <P class="subtitle">This was a huge leadership opportunity, after first years of quick success of turning around IROPS (Irregular Operations) product the management entrusted me with a complex product that has been developed 20 year ago Crew Management solution which was very difficult to maintain and make change - the challenge they gave me was to build a team and deliver a feature Crew Manager on a newer stack that makes upgrades easy, scaling to large airlines and do all this in 2 years with a reference customer - Singapore Airlines, I loved the challenge and started off learning the domain, engaged with Customer service to understand current pitfalls, partnered with Product Management to learn the product vision and built a team from 5 people to 100+ technologists and delivered the first Beta version in 18 months.  Today it is the best comprehensive Crew Management platform available in the market and has won several awards, not to mention 27+ million in revenue from this suite of products</P>
